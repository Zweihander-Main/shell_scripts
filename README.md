# Shell scripts

> Linux shell scripts that merit their own space.

## Usage

If `.env.example` file is present, create a copy called `.env` and change to suit your needs.

## Scripts

### Download Nextcloud
I use a specific Nextcloud News (RSS reader) account purely for videos. This script talks to my local instance, downloads all the unread items using `youtube-dl`, and marks them as read.
